This is a simulation of a simple ecosystem with creatures that can move around and reproduce. The
creatures have a limited amount of energy and can die if they run out of it. The creatures can also
reproduce themselves and pass on their genes to their offspring. The simulation is based on the
concept of genetic algorithms and is intended to demonstrate the principles of evolution and natural
selection.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the simulation.
